# Constructor-Hangman
A hangman command-line game using advanced javascript constructor functions.

The game displays the randomly selected word's letters as dashes and the number of guesses left. Each guess decreases the guess count by 1. The user wins the game by guessing the correct letters before the number of guesses runs out. If the user does not complete the word by the time the guesses equal 0, a game over message is displayed and a new word is randomly selected.
